## OpenAll
The name's probably already taken by someone somewhere for something.

This extension provides a convenient icon that allows you to open all currently displayed listings on reddit in new tabs.  Be carefuly because if your computer or your internet isn't up to the task then you'll be in for a bad time.

I created this because I wanted an easy way to check out the top posts of all time from new subreddits I discovered.  It probably won't work on your machine, so a slight alteration might be necessary.
